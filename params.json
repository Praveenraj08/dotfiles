These are mine.\r\n\r\nThis project is forked from [holman does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). I have personalized them to my liking and added few plugins & automations. If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are\r\nawesome, you might want to [read holman's post on the\r\nsubject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).\r\n\r\n## topical\r\n\r\nEverything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your\r\nforked dotfiles — say, \"Java\" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`. Similarly an extension of `.configsymlink` will get symlinked to `$HOME/.config`.\r\n\r\n## what's inside\r\n\r\nA lot of stuff. Check them out. [Fork it](https://github.com/prasanthkrishnan/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't use, and build on what you do use.\r\nTo name a few,\r\n- [Powerline](https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): awesome python based zsh prompt, tmux & vim status bar.\r\n- Zsh plugins :  [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting), [zsh-navigation-tools](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-navigation-tools),\r\n[zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)\r\n\r\n\r\n## components\r\n\r\nThere's a few special files in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made\r\n  available everywhere.\r\n- **Brewfile**: This is a list of applications for [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io) to install: things like Chrome and 1Password and Adium and stuff. Might want to edit this file before running any initial setup.\r\n- **topic/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your\r\n  environment.\r\n- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is\r\n  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.\r\n- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded\r\n  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.\r\n- **topic/\\*.configsymlink**: Any files ending in `*.configsymlink` get symlinked into your `$HOME/.config`.\r\n- **topic/\\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into\r\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\r\n  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get\r\n  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.\r\n\r\n## install\r\n\r\nRun this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/prasanthkrishnan/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\r\ncd ~/.dotfiles\r\nscript/bootstrap\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.\r\nEverything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.\r\n\r\n`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS\r\ndefaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from\r\ntime to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find\r\nthis script in `bin/`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nI forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)' excellent\r\n[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). This repository is just my personalization over his project.\r\n",
